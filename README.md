# MESA: Medical Education Study Application

This the back-end repo for MESA, the application allows a user to create quizzes. This API was built with Ruby on Rails. MESA was inspired by the need for a way for [PACTS](http://csph.brighamandwomens.org/cultural-dexterity-nih-r01-awarded/) researchers to test surgeons on whether or not they were retaining knowledge from the curriculum the researchers were developing.

## Setup Steps

1. [Fork and clone](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone) this repository.
1. Run `install command` to install all dependencies
1. Use `start command` to spin up the server.

### Unsolved Problems

- The application currently does not allow the user to take a quiz. I would love to implement that functionality in the next version.
- I would like to eventually allow administrators to create the quizzes and only let users take quizzes.
